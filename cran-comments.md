## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the Description field so that it does not start with the package name, 'This package' or similar.

Thank you!


## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the title to:
'Manipulate and Visualize VCF Data'

* The description field has been changed so that it does not start with the package name.

* The redundant "VcfR is intended to allow" has been removed from the Description.


## Test environments
* local ubuntu 12.04, R 3.2.5
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.0
* local OS X install, R 3.3.0
* win-builder (devel and release)


## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 2 NOTEs:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: ‘Brian J. Knaus <briank.lists@gmail.com>’

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  7.7Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    doc    2.8Mb
    libs   4.3Mb

There are 8 vignettes (HTML) which contribute to the 2.8Mb in doc.
These could be migrated to a separate documentation package.
This could reduce this package's size.
Because this is a NOTE and not an ERROR or WARNING I have left it as one package for now.


## Downstream dependencies



## Thank you CRAN core Team!

[CRAN Repository Policy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) states that all correspondence should be with CRAN and not members of the team.
However, I think its polite to thank those who have helped this project.
So I've decided to start a list of thanks with the hope that these individuals may see this in the future.

v1.1.0 Thank you Uwe Ligges for helping me get my title in title case, my Description in order and handling my submission!
